Hey, Iâ€™m @iqrairfan100, a recent graduate from UCLA and computer science student at CSULA. I'm passionate about using my skills to aid others and develop meaningful applications. 

I develop programs using OOP languages such as Java and functional languages such as Javascript and SwiftUI! Additionally, I work with libraries such as React Native. To see more of my skills, check out my portfolio site at iqrairfan.com. 

I am currently working on many personal projects , such as ShareBear, which is an IOS app focused on helping out students looking for essential items. I am also a non-profit director at Purses for a Purpose Los Angeles, which gives back to the local unhoused womens community here in Los Angeles. You can learn more at pursesforapurposela.com.
